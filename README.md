Cleaning Glass Machine
=============
My Cleaning Glass Machine (CGM) could furbish glass or mirror automatically. 
With some special legs, CGM easily stick to glass and moving around. Furthermore, it 
has a processor and sensors to control the direction of CGM in which it can minimize 
time and distance to furbish a certain areas and detect the edge of glass.

Nowadays, there are a lot of product have the same functionality as CGM, 
however, they do not have a battery to work in some high place such as skyscrapers. In 
addition, CGM has a good battery which can enable it to work for hours, furbish about 
60-80m2/hour and its cost is cheaper than other cleaning machine. The potential users of
this product are skyscraper managers to replacement for hundreds of worker working in 
dangerous condition
